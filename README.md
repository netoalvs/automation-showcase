Welcome to my **Automation Showcase**! This project is a collection of automated tests that demonstrate my skills in QA automation using **Cypress**. It covers a wide range of scenarios, including **UI testing**, **API testing**, and **database testing**, using real-world sites like [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com), [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com), [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/), and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Docker** (optional, for running database tests locally). You can download it from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).

### Installation
1. **Install Cypress**:
   If you donâ€™t have Cypress installed, you can install it globally or locally in your project. For this project, I recommend installing it locally:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:netoalvs/automation-showcase.git
   cd automation-showcase
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create an `env-config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "SAUCEDEMO_USER": "standard_user",
     "SAUCEDEMO_PASSWORD": "secret_sauce",
     "API_EMAIL": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
     "API_PASSWORD": "cityslicka",
     "DB_HOST": "localhost",
     "DB_USER": "root",
     "DB_PASSWORD": "root",
     "DB_NAME": "test_db"
   }
   ```

5. **Run the tests**:

   To run all tests in headless mode:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

   To open Cypress in interactive mode:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

### Database Tests (Optional):
If you want to run database tests, start the MySQL container using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Then, run the database tests:
```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/database/query-db.cy.js"
```

## ðŸ§  What I've Learned
Through this project, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with Cypress and deepened my understanding of automated testing in real-world applications. Here are some key takeaways:

- **UI Testing**: I learned how to handle dynamic content, interact with forms, and use the Page Object Model (POM) to create maintainable and reusable tests.
- **API Testing**: I explored complex scenarios like authentication, header validation, and handling different HTTP status codes.
- **Database Testing**: I integrated MySQL with Cypress to validate data integrity and test database transactions.
- **Best Practices**: I applied best practices for organizing tests, using environment variables, and integrating with Docker for database testing.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
I plan to continue enhancing this project by:
- Adding Advanced API Tests: Implementing tests for rate limiting, pagination, and token refresh workflows.
- Performance Testing: Adding performance tests to measure the efficiency of the APIs and the application under load.
- Visual Regression Testing: Integrating visual regression testing to ensure the UI remains consistent across versions.
- CI/CD Integration: Automating the testing process using continuous integration tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
